### Project Setup

- Initialized the project using the Vite bundler for a fast React development environment.
- Cleaned up the default template and added a simple "Hello ...!" message as a starting point.
- Installed and configured **Tailwind CSS** and **styled-components** for flexible styling options.
- Set up ESLint for code quality, including scripts for linting and automatically fixing issues (`eslint --fix`).
